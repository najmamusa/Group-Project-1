## Usage 

The application's main focus is providing you with personalised book recommendations.

On the landing page, you are encountered with a bestsellers section, recommending you what New York Times deems the hottest reads at the moment.

If, however, you are not one to follow the crowd and want something more fine tuned, you can head to the _Books_ section of the webpage, where you can input a book title or author you enjoy and be provided a variety of similar reads.

Alongside the recommendation is a modal of all you need to know about the book itself, including the synopsis, book length, rating and more. 

If digital books are not your thing and you prefer to take a look for yourself, the _Book Store_ page will guide you to your local bookstores.
